Magic variables, are use to capture the output of a function. These are not mutable variables (meaning there values can not be edited). To assign the output of a function to a variable you can use the following syntax

```
Text("Hello World!") >> HelloWorld
```

You can use magic variables in the input to other functions the same as you can with regular variables.
